# PassListGenerator
This program generates random passwords with customizable options, such as:

- Password length: Define the number of characters in each password.
- Excluded characters: Specify which characters should be excluded.
- Character positioning: Set specific characters at defined positions in the password.
- Character counts: Control how many times a specific character should appear.
## Features:
- Customizable password length, character exclusions, and specific character placements.
- Ensures passwords meet specified criteria for character counts and positions.
- Displays real-time progress while generating passwords.
- Saves valid passwords to a text file (passwords.txt).

This program also works great alongside my Password bruteforcer, helping you generate password lists you can use for testing my bruteforcer.

It makes sure all passwords follow the rules before saving them, so you get only the valid ones.
